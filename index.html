      In a world full of noise, you were the melody I never knew I was missing. <br><br>
      I’ve watched the stars, searched the sky, but none ever shined like the way your smile lights up the chaos in my mind. <br><br>
      We’ve shared laughter, late-night talks, and the quiet that only exists when two hearts truly see each other. <br><br>
      So here I am — not with lines rehearsed, but with truth in my chest… <br><br>
      Will you walk into the unknown with me, hand in hand, heart in sync? <br><br>
      <strong class="text-pink-600 text-xl">Will you be mine — not just for a moment, but for every chapter after this?</strong>
